# PicNext Prototype

This is an initial sketch out of the Next.js side of the new [] web instance project.

- NextJS with Typescript
- Built with SCSS
- Storybook for Documentation/Design System (likely to be separate)
- Docker set up, please read below. Ideally

## How to use

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-docker picnext_prototype
# or
yarn create next-app --example with-docker picnext_prototype
# or
pnpm create next-app --example with-docker picnext_prototype
```

## Using Docker

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your machine.
1. Build your container: `docker build -t nextjs-docker .`.
1. Run your container: `docker run -p 3000:3000 nextjs-docker`.

You can view your images created with `docker images`.

```

This will build the project as a standalone app inside the Docker image.

## Deploying to AWS

## Running Locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
